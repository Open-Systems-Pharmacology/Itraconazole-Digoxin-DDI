# Itraconazole-Digoxin-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Itraconazole-Digoxin-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of our models regarding the Itraconazole-Digoxin-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied itraconazole model is an improved version of the itraconazole/hydroxy-itraconazole compound template provided in PK-Sim; the compound template will be updated as soon as possible. For further details and documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
